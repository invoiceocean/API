<a name="token"/>

## API token

`API_TOKEN` token has to be downloaded from application settings ("Settings -> Account settings -> Integration -> API Authorization Code")

<a name="list_params"/>

## Additional parameters for downloading lists of records

Additional parameters can be forwarded to calls (same as in application), e.g. `page=`, `period=` etc.

`page=` parameter allows to iteration over paginated records.
By default it is '1' what gives first N records, when N is the limit of the records in response.
In order to download next N records, parameter `page=2` should be forwarded to call and so forth.

`period=` parameter allows to select records from given period.
Possible values:
- last_12_months
- this_month
- last_30_days
- last_month
- this_year
- last_year
- all
- more (in that case, additional parameters date_from (e.g "2018-12-16") and date_to ("2018-12-21") should be passed)

## Link to invoice preview and PDF download

After downloading invoice data, e.g. by:

```shell
curl https://YOUR_DOMAIN.invoiceocean.com/invoices/100.json?api_token=API_TOKEN
```

API gives us `token` field, on which basis we may receive invoice preview links 
Such links allow you to refer to the selected invoice without having to log in - you can, for instance, send these links to the customer, who will have access to invoices and PDF.

Links are in the form: 

preview: `http://yourdomain.invoiceocean.com/invoice/{{token}}` 
pdf: `http://yourdomain.invoiceocean.com/invoice/{{token}}.pdf`

E.g. for token equal: `HBO3Npx2OzSW79RQL7XV2` public PDF will be at `http://yourdomain.invoiceocean.com/invoice/HBO3Npx2OzSW79RQL7XV2.pdf`

## Examples of using PHP - purchase of training

`TODO` 

Flow Portal Example which generates a proforma invoice for the client, sends it to the client and after receiving payment, sends the training ticket to the client

* Client fills in details in the Portal
* The Portal calls API from invoiceocean.com and generates an invoice
* The Portal sends a Proforma PDF invoice to the Client along with a payment link
* Client makes a payment for the Proforma invoice (e.g. using PayPal)
* InvoiceOcean.com receives information that the payment has been made, generates VAT invoice and sends it to the client and calls Portal API
* After receiving information regarding payment (by API) Portal sends the training ticket to the Client

## Invoices


* `GET /invoices/1.json` downloading invoice
* `POST /invoices.json` adding a new invoice
* `PUT /invoices/1.json` updating invoice
* `DELETE /invoices/1.json` deleting invoice


Example - adding a new invoice - the minimal version (only fields required), when we have product, buyer and seller ID we do not need to provide full details. Field department_id determines the company (or department) which issues the invoice (it can be obtained by clicking on the company in Settings> Data Company)

```shell
curl http://YOUR_DOMAIN.invoiceocean.com/invoices.json \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"api_token": "API_TOKEN",
        "invoice": {
            "payment_to_kind": 5,
